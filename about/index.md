# About

## Who am I?
My username is [AvaxarXapaxa](https://github.com/AvaxarXapaxa) and I'm a programmer hobbyist. I'm interested in gamedev and neural networks. I like to program using Python and C++, but don't mind if my code looks weird..? No nerd stuff around here :) To help things out in C++, I use SFML which provides cross-platform functions.

## Any other people here?
Also... I'm working with my friend, [Neuxbane](https://github.com/Neuxbane)! He programs in Python and also interested in neural nets.

## So... what is this for?
Neaxture is where I'll put my projects on! Don't expect professional stuff with professional code! We're just hobbyists... stick around!
