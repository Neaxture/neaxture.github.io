> Frick it, I'm not a fan of isometric rendering. I'll take a shot at making an actual 3D engine. My idea to do the Z buffer is to squish the projection view into an orthographic view, by squishing the far bits by /z then interpolating the triangle with its points' depth.

> It would be hard to implement a 3D engine on SFML, so... we move on to the second resort of making it isometric! The engine is on the works and still figuring out how to make it and implementing some features without nerdy stuffs. Also! I've added a new page, "Notes" where I save useful code which I could reuse also links to save that I'll share for useful stuff.
