## Abstrac [IMPLEMENTING...]
**Status** In implementation stage... <br/>
**Language/Tool used** C++, SFML, ARSS, FFMPEG <br/>
**Summary** Abstrac *will be* a 3D "simulation/environment", or some sort... Which provides a virtual programming environment in a 3D like game. Although sounds ridiculous at first... It could hopefully fuel productivity. Abstrac programming *is planned to use* block coding and could compile down into a bytecode which is executed by the Abstrac interpreter. Also... a multiplayer/server system would be nice to do a collaboration mode, heck... virtual world programmer social media it is :v I could also hopefully implement a couple of "poorly written" toolkits like audio recording, audio manipulation, image manipulation, video rendering and some sort using ARSS, FFMPEG, and SFML which provides good stuff. <br/>
**Problems** 3D engine still on the works. Using... poorly written code. If the performance is poor, dunno what to do <br/>
**Second Resort** If the 3D engine's performance's poor, maybe I'll go back to isometric rendering <br/>
**Third Resort** ... <br/>
