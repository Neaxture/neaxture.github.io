#### Abstrac
**Status:** Still in planning...
**Language/Tool used** C++, SFML, ARSS, FFMPEG
**Summary** Abstrac *will be* a 3D "simulation/environment", or some sort... Which provides a virtual programming environment in a 3D like game. Although sounds ridiculous at first... It could hopefully fuel productivity. Abstrac programming *is planned to use* block coding and could compile down into a bytecode which is executed by the Abstrac interpreter. Also... a multiplayer/server system would be nice to do a collaboration mode, heck... virtual world programmer social media it is :v I could also hopefully implement a couple of "poorly written" toolkits like audio recording, audio manipulation, image manipulation, video rendering and some sort using ARSS, FFMPEG, and SFML which provides good stuff.
**Problems** A need of a 3D engine which is using SFML (The graphics would be simplistic, no need fancy GPU also... I've made my own using pygame and painter's algorithm but it's slow, don't know about that more efficient Z buffer work [More like... in practice])
**Second Resort** If I couldn't manage to get a 3D engine or create it, maybe it'll be pseudo 3D?
**Third Resort** ...
