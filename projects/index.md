## Abstrac [IMPLEMENTING...]
**Status** In implementation stage... <br/>
**Language/Tool used** C++, SFML, ARSS, FFMPEG <br/>
**Summary** Abstrac *will be* a 3D "simulation/environment", or some sort... Which provides a virtual programming environment in a 3D like game. Although sounds ridiculous at first... It could hopefully fuel productivity. Abstrac programming *is planned to use* block coding and could compile down into a bytecode which is executed by the Abstrac interpreter. Also... a multiplayer/server system would be nice to do a collaboration mode, heck... virtual world programmer social media it is :v I could also hopefully implement a couple of "poorly written" toolkits like audio recording, audio manipulation, image manipulation, video rendering and some sort using ARSS, FFMPEG, and SFML which provides good stuff. <br/>
**Update** THE [3D ENGINE](https://youtu.be/80JCn1t29G8) IS CRAP! GOING TO THE SECOND RESORT: ISOMETRIC.
